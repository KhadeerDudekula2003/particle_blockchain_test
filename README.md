# particle_blockchain_test
This repository contains codes from my blockchain project, developed over two years by my team and me. Since our original GitHub repo is private, I created this PUBLIC repository to share some of the code I personally wrote. Contributions by me and my team are clearly specified, and all code includes comments explaining its purpose.
