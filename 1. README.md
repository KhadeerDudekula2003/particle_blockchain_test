# particle_blockchain_test
These are codes from my blockchain project Iâ€™m developing, representing two years of effort by me and my team. Our original GitHub repository is private and thats why i created this new PUBLIC repository and give some of my codes that I wrote. I SPECIFICALLY  mentioned my contributions and my team contributions. All codes are tested, with comments explaining its purpose. To run the codes, please ensure the files are saved in the correct directories. All codes are tested and free of technical errors

        >.........< codes have been adjusted for privacy but remain fully tested and executable  >.........<
