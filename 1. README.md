# particle_blockchain_test
These are codes from my blockchain project Iâ€™m developing, representing two years of effort by me and my team. Our original GitHub repository is private and thats why i created this new PUBLIC repository and give some of my codes that I wrote. I SPECIFICALLY mentioned my contributions and my team contributions. All codes are tested, with comments explaining its purpose.

   >.........< codes have been adjusted for privacy but remain fully tested and executable  >.........<
